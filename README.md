# Top_level_detector
This is a project to make life easier for verification engineers to get the top-level module name, module count, and more(coming up next!) from a big RTL or Gate Level Netlist

## How to use it?

You can find an open command in the .py file, where you must put your filepath and are ready. The report for now will give you the name of the top module of the given design file and the number of module defined in the file. We will have more feature eventually in future to make it even better.
